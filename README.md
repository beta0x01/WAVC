# The Web Application Vulnerabilities (Bug Bounty) Cheatsheet [WAVC]
Hi, I'm Ibrahim Beta
بفضل الله وتوفيقه
I created this repo for every Bug-Bounty Hunter / Pentester, I collected the content from other repoes, i will share the repoes' names here.

## Best practice
- You have Testing Checklist, Recon Checklist, and Notes Tempaltes. Go through the checklist (beside the cheatsheets are numbered based-on the checklist too).
- You can manage both main checklist and recon checklist so they are interfered. this is the best workflow.
- Taking notes are easy too with the notes tamplate you can go.
- For each Target you have copy those file into its dirctory and complete checks and HUNT!
